These are the Actionscript 3 libraries by Freeform Systems, this source tree uses "maven":http://maven.apache.org for the build process.

h2. Maven Builds

If you are using "maven":http://maven.apache.org and "flexmojos":http://flexmojos.sonatype.org/ for your project this is some information on repository configuration and declaring the dependencies.

You need to configure your maven settings to point to our public repository so that the dependencies can be resolved. An example maven settings file is available in the "mvn-settings repository":https://github.com/freeformsystems/mvn-settings.

You can then simply declare a dependency in your POM on any of the artifacts in this repository. For example:

bc. <dependency>
	<groupId>com.ffsys.flash.flashx</groupId>
	<artifactId>core</artifactId>
	<version>0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
	<type>swc</type>
</dependency>
