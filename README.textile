h1. Actionscript 3 Libraries

These are the Actionscript 3 libraries by Freeform Systems, this source tree uses "maven":http://maven.apache.org for the build process.

h2. Maven Builds

If you just want to use the libraries in your "flexmojos":http://flexmojos.sonatype.org/ project this is some information on repository configuration and declaring the dependencies.

You need to declare a repository that points to our public repository, so that the library artifact dependencies can be resolved. An example maven settings file is available in the "mvn-settings repository":https://github.com/freeformsystems/mvn-settings
