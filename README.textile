h1. Freeform Systems -- Core Actionscript 3 Libraries

These are the core Actionscript 3 libraries by Freeform Systems.

All source code is distributed with a "Creative Commons attribution and share-alike license":http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/uk/.

h2. Using the libraries

If you just want to use the libraries in your "flexmojos":http://flexmojos.sonatype.org/ project this is some information on declaring the dependencies.

You need to declare a repository that points to our public repository, so that the library artifact dependencies can be resolved:

bc. <repositories>
	<snapshotRepository>
		<id>ffsys-repository</id>
		<name>Freeform Systems Snapshots Repository</name>
		<url>http://mvn.freeformsystems.com/content/repositories/snapshots/</url>
	</snapshotRepository>
	<repository>
		<id>ffsys-repository</id>
		<name>Freeform Systems Repository</name>
		<url>http://mvn.freeformsystems.com/content/repositories/releases/</url>
	</repository>
</repositories>

h2. Forking

For those that wish to fork the source tree some information on getting the source and compiling it is below.

h3. Prerequisites

You will need "maven":http://maven.apache.org installed. The project was built using version 2.2.1, your mileage may vary on earlier versions. The compiling and asdoc generation is handled by "flexmojos":http://flexmojos.sonatype.org/ we recommend reading the "flexmojos wiki":https://docs.sonatype.org/display/FLEXMOJOS/Home if you are not familiar with "flexmojos":http://flexmojos.sonatype.org/.

Note that "maven":http://maven.apache.org will handle the "flexmojos":http://flexmojos.sonatype.org/ dependencies automatically so you should just need "maven":http://maven.apache.org installed in order to compile the project.

h3. Getting the code

Create a clone of the repository:

bc. git clone git@github.com:freeformsystems/as3-core.git

h3. Compiling the code

To compile all the modules for the project, change into the directory, for example:

bc. cd ~/git/as3-core

And run maven:

bc. mvn install

This will also go through the process of resolving all the project's dependencies and creating and installing the artifacts in your local repository.

h3. Releasing the code

We use:

bc. mvn release:prepare && mvn release:perform

To tag the source tree, create a release version and increment to the next snapshot, if you wish to do the same you will need to modify the POM to suit your release infrastructure and requirements.
