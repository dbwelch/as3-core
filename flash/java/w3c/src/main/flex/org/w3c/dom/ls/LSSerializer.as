	/**
	* 	A LSSerializer provides an API for serializing (writing)
	* 	a DOM document out into XML.
	* 
	* 	<p>The XML data is written to a string or an output stream.
	* 	Any changes or fixups made during the serialization affect
	* 	only the serialized data. The Document object and its children
	* 	are never altered by the serialization operation.</p>
	* 
	* 	<p>During serialization of XML data, namespace fixup is
	* 	done as defined in [DOM Level 3 Core] , Appendix B.
	* 	[DOM Level 2 Core] allows empty strings as a real
	* 	namespace URI. If the namespaceURI of a Node is empty
	* 	string, the serialization will treat them as null,
	* 	ignoring the prefix if any.</p>
	* 
	* 	<p>LSSerializer accepts any node type for serialization.
	* 	For nodes of type Document or Entity, well-formed XML will
	* 	be created when possible (well-formedness is guaranteed if
	* 	the document or entity comes from a parse operation and is
	* 	unchanged since it was created). The serialized output for
	* 	these node types is either as a XML document or an External
	* 	XML Entity, respectively, and is acceptable input for an
	* 	XML parser. For all other types of nodes the serialized
	* 	form is implementation dependent.</p>
	* 
	* 	<p>Within a Document, DocumentFragment, or Entity being
	* 	serialized, Nodes are processed as follows:</p>
	* 
	* 	<ul>
	* 		<li>Document nodes are written, including the XML
	* 		declaration (unless the parameter "xml-declaration"
	* 		is set to false) and a DTD subset, if one exists in the
	* 		DOM. Writing a Document node serializes the entire document.</li>
	* 		<li>Entity nodes, when written directly by LSSerializer.write,
	* 		outputs the entity expansion but no namespace fixup is done.
	* 		The resulting output will be valid as an external entity.</li>
	* 		<li>If the parameter " entities" is set to true, EntityReference
	* 		nodes are serialized as an entity reference of the form "&amp;entityName;"
	* 		in the output. Child nodes (the expansion) of the entity reference
	* 		are ignored. If the parameter "entities" is set to false, only
	* 		the children of the entity reference are serialized. EntityReference
	* 		nodes with no children (no corresponding Entity node or the
	* 		corresponding Entity nodes have no children) are always serialized.</li>
	* 		<li>CDATAsections containing content characters that cannot be
	* 		represented in the specified output encoding are handled according
	* 		to the "split-cdata-sections" parameter. If the parameter is set to true,
	* 		CDATAsections are split, and the unrepresentable characters are serialized
	* 		as numeric character references in ordinary content. The exact position
	* 		and number of splits is not specified. If the parameter is set to false,
	* 		unrepresentable characters in a CDATAsection are reported as "wf-invalid-character"
	* 		errors if the parameter "well-formed" is set to true. The error is not recoverable
	* 		-- there is no mechanism for supplying alternative characters and
	* 		continuing with the serialization.</li>
	* 		<li>DocumentFragment nodes are serialized by serializing the
	* 		children of the document fragment in the order they appear in
	* 		the document fragment.</li>
	* 		<li>All other node types (Element, Text, etc.) are serialized
	* 		to their corresponding XML source form.</li>
	* 	</ul>
	* 
	* 	<p><strong>Note:</strong> The serialization of a Node does
	* 	not always generate a well-formed XML document, i.e. a LSParser
	* 	might throw fatal errors when parsing the resulting serialization.</p>
	* 
	* 	<p>Within the character data of a document (outside of markup),
	* 	any characters that cannot be represented directly are replaced
	* 	with character references. Occurrences of '&lt;' and '&amp;' are
	* 	replaced by the predefined entities &lt;lt; and &amp;amp;. The
	* 	other predefined entities (&amp;gt;, &amp;apos;, and &amp;quot;)
	* 	might not be used, except where needed (e.g. using &gt;gt; in cases
	* 	such as ']]&gt;'). Any characters that cannot be represented
	* 	directly in the output character encoding are serialized as
	* 	numeric character references (and since character encoding
	* 	standards commonly use hexadecimal representations of characters,
	* 	using the hexadecimal representation when serializing character
	* 	references is encouraged).</p>
	* 
	* 	<p>To allow attribute values to contain both single and double quotes,
	* 	the apostrophe or single-quote character (') may be represented as
	* 	"&amp;apos;", and the double-quote character (") as "&amp;quot;".
	* 	New line characters and other characters that cannot be represented
	* 	directly in attribute values in the output character encoding are
	* 	serialized as a numeric character reference.</p>
	* 
	* 	<p>Within markup, but outside of attributes, any occurrence
	* 	of a character that cannot be represented in the output character
	* 	encoding is reported as a DOMError fatal error. An example would be
	* 	serializing the element <code>&lt;LaCa√±ada/&gt;</code> with encoding="us-ascii".
	* 	This will result with a generation of a DOMError "wf-invalid-character-in-node-name"
	* 	(as proposed in "well-formed").</p>
	* 
	* 	<p>When requested by setting the parameter "normalize-characters"
	* 	on LSSerializer to true, character normalization is performed
	* 	according to the definition of fully normalized characters
	* 	included in appendix E of [XML 1.1] on all data to be serialized,
	* 	both markup and character data. The character normalization process
	* 	affects only the data as it is being written; it does not alter the
	* 	DOM's view of the document after serialization has completed.</p>
	* 
	* 	<p>Implementations are required to support the encodings
	* 	"UTF-8", "UTF-16", "UTF-16BE", and "UTF-16LE" to guarantee
	* 	that data is serializable in all encodings that are required
	* 	to be supported by all XML parsers. When the encoding is UTF-8,
	* 	whether or not a byte order mark is serialized, or if the output
	* 	is big-endian or little-endian, is implementation dependent. When
	* 	the encoding is UTF-16, whether or not the output is big-endian
	* 	or little-endian is implementation dependent, but a Byte Order Mark
	* 	must be generated for non-character outputs, such as
	* 	LSOutput.byteStream or LSOutput.systemId. If the Byte Order Mark
	* 	is not generated, a "byte-order-mark-needed" warning is reported.
	* 	When the encoding is UTF-16LE or UTF-16BE, the output is big-endian
	* 	(UTF-16BE) or little-endian (UTF-16LE) and the Byte Order Mark is
	* 	not be generated. In all cases, the encoding declaration, if
	* 	generated, will correspond to the encoding used during the
	* 	serialization (e.g. encoding="UTF-16" will appear if
	* 	UTF-16 was requested).</p>
	* 
	* 	<p>Namespaces are fixed up during serialization, the serialization
	* 	process will verify that namespace declarations, namespace prefixes
	* 	and the namespace URI associated with elements and attributes are
	* 	consistent. If inconsistencies are found, the serialized form of
	* 	the document will be altered to remove them. The method used for
	* 	doing the namespace fixup while serializing a document is the
	* 	algorithm defined in Appendix B.1, "Namespace normalization",
	* 	of [DOM Level 3 Core].</p>
	* 
	* 	<p>While serializing a document, the parameter
	* 	"discard-default-content" controls whether or not non-specified
	* 	data is serialized.</p>
	* 
	* 	<p>While serializing, errors and warnings are reported to
	* 	the application through the error handler (LSSerializer.domConfig's
	* 	"error-handler" parameter). This specification does in no way try to
	* 	define all possible errors and warnings that can occur while
	* 	serializing a DOM node, but some common error and warning cases
	* 	are defined. The types ( DOMError.type) of errors and warnings
	* 	defined by this specification are:</p>
	* 
	* 	<ul>
	* 		<li><code>"no-output-specified" [fatal]</code> -- 
	* 		Raised when writing to a LSOutput if no output is specified in the LSOutput.</li>
	* 		<li><code>"unbound-prefix-in-entity-reference" [fatal]</code> --
	* 		Raised if the configuration parameter "namespaces" is set to true
	* 		and an entity whose replacement text contains unbound namespace
	* 		prefixes is referenced in a location where there are no bindings for
	* 		the namespace prefixes.</li>
	* 		<li><code>"unsupported-encoding" [fatal]</code> --
	* 		Raised if an unsupported encoding is encountered.</li>
	* 	</ul>
	* 
	* 	<p>In addition to raising the defined errors and warnings,
	* 	implementations are expected to raise implementation specific errors
	* 	and warnings for any other error and warning cases such as IO errors
	* 	(file not found, permission denied,...) and so on.</p>
	* 
	* 	<p>See also the Document Object Model (DOM) Level 3 Load and Save Specification.</p>

		* 	the following parameters:
		* 
		* 	<p><code>"canonical-form"</code></p>
		* 
		* 	true [optional] Writes the document according to the
		* 	rules specified in [Canonical XML]. In addition to the behavior
		* 	described in " canonical-form" [DOM Level 3 Core] , setting this parameter
		* 	to true will set the parameters "format-pretty-print", "discard-default-content",
		* 	and "xml-declaration ", to false. Setting one of those parameters to true will
		* 	set this parameter to false. Serializing an XML 1.1 document when "canonical-form"
		* 	is true will generate a fatal error.
		* 
		*	false [required] (default) Do not canonicalize the output.
		* 
		* 	<p><code>"discard-default-content"</code></p>
		* 
		* 	true [required] (default) Use the Attr.specified attribute to
		* 	decide what attributes should be discarded. Note that some
		* 	implementations might use whatever information available to
		* 	the implementation (i.e. XML schema, DTD, the Attr.specified attribute,
		* 	and so on) to determine what attributes and content to discard
		* 	if this parameter is set to true.
		* 
		*	false [required] Keep all attributes and all content.
		* 
		* 	<p><code>"format-pretty-print"</code></p>
		* 	
		*	true [optional] Formatting the output by adding whitespace to produce a pretty-printed, indented, human-readable form. The exact form of the transformations is not specified by this specification. Pretty-printing changes the content of the document and may affect the validity of the document, validating implementations should preserve validity.
		*
		*	false [required] (default) Don't pretty-print the result.
		* 
		* 	<p><code>"ignore-unknown-character-denormalizations"</code></p>
		* 
		* 	true [required] (default) If, while verifying full normalization
		* 	when [XML 1.1] is supported, a character is encountered for which
		* 	the normalization properties cannot be determined, then raise a
		* 	"unknown-character-denormalization" warning (instead of raising an error,
		* 	if this parameter is not set) and ignore any possible denormalizations
		* 	caused by these characters.
		* 
		*	false [optional] Report a fatal error if a character is encountered for
		* 	which the processor cannot determine the normalization properties.
		* 
		* 	<p><code>"normalize-characters"</code></p>
		* 
		* 	This parameter is equivalent to the one defined by DOMConfiguration
		* 	in [DOM Level 3 Core] . Unlike in the Core, the default value for this
		* 	parameter is true. While DOM implementations are not required to support
		* 	fully normalizing the characters in the document according to appendix E of [XML 1.1],
		* 	this parameter must be activated by default if supported.
		* 
		* 	<p><code>"xml-declaration"</code></p>
		* 
		* 	true [required] (default) If a Document, Element, or Entity
		* 	node is serialized, the XML declaration, or text declaration,
		* 	should be included. The version (Document.xmlVersion if the document
		* 	is a Level 3 document and the version is non-null, otherwise use the value "1.0"),
		* 	and the output encoding (see LSSerializer.write for details on how to find
		* 	the output encoding) are specified in the serialized XML declaration.
		*
		* 	false [required] Do not serialize the XML and text declarations.
		* 	Report a "xml-declaration-needed" warning if this will cause problems
		* 	(i.e. the serialized data is of an XML version other than [XML 1.0], or
		* 	an encoding would be needed to be able to re-parse the serialized data).
