	/**
	* 	Represents an attribute.
	* 
	* 	<p>The Attr interface represents an attribute
	* 	in an Element object. Typically the allowable
	* 	values for the attribute are defined in a
	* 	schema associated with the document.</p>
	* 
	* 	<p>Attr objects inherit the Node interface,
	* 	but since they are not actually child nodes
	* 	of the element they describe, the DOM does
	* 	not consider them part of the document tree.
	* 	Thus, the Node attributes parentNode,
	* 	previousSibling, and nextSibling have a
	* 	null value for Attr objects. The DOM takes
	* 	the view that attributes are properties of
	* 	elements rather than having a separate identity
	* 	from the elements they are associated with; this
	* 	should make it more efficient to implement such
	* 	features as default attributes associated with all
	* 	elements of a given type. Furthermore, Attr nodes
	* 	may not be immediate children of a DocumentFragment.
	* 	However, they can be associated with Element nodes
	* 	contained within a DocumentFragment. In short
	* 	users and implementors of the DOM need to be
	* 	aware that Attr nodes have some things in common
	* 	with other objects inheriting the Node interface,
	* 	but they also are quite distinct.</p>
	* 
	* 	<p>The attribute's effective value is determined
	* 	as follows: if this attribute has been explicitly
	* 	assigned any value, that value is the attribute's
	* 	effective value; otherwise, if there is a declaration
	* 	for this attribute, and that declaration includes a
	* 	default value, then that default value is the attribute's
	* 	effective value; otherwise, the attribute does not exist
	* 	on this element in the structure model until it has
	* 	been explicitly added. Note that the Node.nodeValue
	* 	attribute on the Attr instance can also be used to
	* 	retrieve the string version of the attribute's value(s).</p>
	* 
	* 	<p>If the attribute was not explicitly given a value
	* 	in the instance document but has a default value provided
	* 	by the schema associated with the document, an attribute
	* 	node will be created with specified set to false.
	* 	Removing attribute nodes for which a default value is
	* 	defined in the schema generates a new attribute node
	* 	with the default value and specified set to false.
	* 	If validation occurred while invoking
	* 	Document.normalizeDocument(), attribute nodes with
	* 	specified equals to false are recomputed according to
	* 	the default attribute values provided by the schema.
	* 	If no default value is associate with this attribute
	* 	in the schema, the attribute node is discarded.</p>
	* 
	* 	<p>In XML, where the value of an attribute can contain
	* 	entity references, the child nodes of the Attr node
	* 	may be either Text or EntityReference nodes (when these
	* 	are in use; see the description of EntityReference for discussion).</p>
	* 
	* 	<p>The DOM Core represents all attribute values as
	* 	simple strings, even if the DTD or schema associated
	* 	with the document declares them of some specific
	* 	type such as tokenized.</p>
	* 
	* 	<p>The way attribute value normalization is performed
	* 	by the DOM implementation depends on how much the
	* 	implementation knows about the schema in use. Typically,
	* 	the value and nodeValue attributes of an Attr node
	* 	initially returns the normalized value given by the parser.
	* 	It is also the case after Document.normalizeDocument()
	* 	is called (assuming the right options have been set).
	* 	But this may not be the case after mutation, independently
	* 	of whether the mutation is performed by setting the
	* 	string value directly or by changing the Attr child nodes.
	* 	In particular, this is true when character references
	* 	are involved, given that they are not represented in
	* 	the DOM and they impact attribute value normalization.
	* 	On the other hand, if the implementation knows about the
	* 	schema in use when the attribute value is changed,
	* 	and it is of a different type than CDATA,
	* 	it may normalize it again at that time.
	* 	This is especially true of specialized DOM implementations,
	* 	such as SVG DOM implementations, which store attribute
	* 	values in an internal form different from a string.</p>
	* 
	* 	<p>The following examples illustrate
	* 	the relationship between the attribute value in
	* 	the original document (parsed attribute), the value as
	* 	exposed in the DOM, and the serialization of the value:</p>
	* 	
	* 	<ul>
	* 		<li><p>Character reference</p></li>
